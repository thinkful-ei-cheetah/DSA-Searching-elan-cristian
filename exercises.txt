1a. [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18] -> 8

middle is 11 
8 < 11 so our list is now 3, 5, 6, 8
new middle is 5
8 > 5 so our new list is 6, 8
new middle is 6
6 < 8 so we get rid of six, leaving us with 8

1b. [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18] -> 16

middle is 11
16 > 11 so our list is 12, 14, 15, 17, 18
new middle is 15
16 > 15 so our list is 17, 18
new middle is 17
16 < 17 so we must be missing
